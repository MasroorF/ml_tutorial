## Machine learning tutorial 

This machine learning tutorial is designed to take a code literate, but python novice from the basic needs of MAchine Language (ML) to running a pretty sophisticated Neural Network using python, numpy, Tensorflow and Keras. This will never be an exhastive exploration of any topic, but more of a guideline to get started in ML.

We will use jupyter notebooks to go through the topics.  The plan is to have the following notebooks.

- [x] Basic python functions pertaining to getting up and running in python for ML only. This includes the `if`, `while`, `for` statements. Basic datastructures include Lists `[]`, Dictionaries `{}`and Tuples `()`
- [x] Functions (the `def` kind).  Some math functions that would be handy to know. Simpe assignment
- [ ] Intriduction to numpy. Getting to know numpy arrays. Basic matrix algebra.  numpy.dot vs. numpy.mul
- [ ] Introductoion to Scypi and Pandas (maybe I'll ignore Scipy)
- [ ] Introduction to Neural Networks
- [ ] Rolling a Neural Network using numpy only
- [ ] Introduction to Tensorflow. Basic tf commands and concepts
- [ ] Maybe do the mnist exercise? or maybe another one
- [ ] Introduction to CNN
- [ ] Do a CNN excercise using Keras
- [ ] This list is incomplete
